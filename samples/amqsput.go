/*
 * This is an example of a Go program to put messages to an IBM MQ
 * queue.
 *
 * The queue and queue manager name can be given as parameters on the
 * command line. Defaults are coded in the program.
 * This sample also permits use of environment variables for the
 * parameters, which might be preferable in some container
 * deployments.
 *
 * A single message is put, containing a "hello" and timestamp.
 * Each MQI call prints its success or failure. The MsgId of the
 * put message is also printed so it can be used as an optional
 * selection criterion on the amqsget sample program.
 *

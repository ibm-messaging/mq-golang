 * This is an example of a Go program to publish messages to an IBM MQ

 *
 * The topic and queue manager name can be given as parameters on the
 * command line. Defaults are coded in the program.
 *
 * A single message is published, containing a "hello" and timestamp.
 * Each MQI call prints its success or failure.

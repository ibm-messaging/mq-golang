/*
This is a short sample to show how to connect to a remote
queue manager in a Go program without requiring external
client configuration such as a CCDT. Only the basic
parameters are needed here - channel name and connection information -
along with the queue manager name.

For example, run as

	amqsconn QMGR1 "SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN" "myhost.example.com(1414)"

If the MQSAMP_USER_ID environment variable is set, then a userid/password
flow is also made to authenticate to the queue manager.

There is no attempt in this sample to configure advanced security features
such TLS.

If an error occurs, the error is reported.

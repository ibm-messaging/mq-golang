/*
This is a short sample to show how to connect to a remote
queue manager in a Go program with a TLS connection without requiring external
client configuration such as a CCDT. The basic
parameters are still needed here - channel name and connection information -
along with the queue manager name.

For example, run as

	amqsconn QMGR1 "SYSTEM.SSL.SVRCONN" "myhost.example.com(1414)"

If the MQSAMP_USER_ID environment variable is set, then a userid/password
flow is also made to authenticate to the queue manager.

If an error occurs, the error is reported.

# This Dockerfile has two separate stages.
#
# The first stage is used to compile the Go program, where we need tools like the Go and C compilers.
# The second stage is a runtime-only container that holds just the things we need to
# execute the compiled program.
#
# Files and directories are copied from the builder container to the runtime container as needed.
#
# The base images are taken from the Red Hat Universal Base Images repository

# Start by setting some global variables that can still be overridden on the build command line.

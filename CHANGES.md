examples of how MQRC/MQCC codes can now be tested and extracted. This change
makes the MQI implementation a bit more natural for Go environments.

## 10 Jan 2017

See the [README](cmd/mq_json/README.md) for more details.
* Fixed bug where freespace metrics were showing as non-integer bytes, not percentages

## 17 Oct 2016

* Added some Windows support. An example batch file is included in the mq_influx directory;
